# Photon-Project
Image search page that fetches from an API. Techologies used: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and SASS.
This project was to re-familiarize myself with async await, and working with APIs.
If you would like to try this out, you will need your own API auth code from pexels.com in order for this to work.
